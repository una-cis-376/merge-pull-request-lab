## steps, all on GitHub (no clone or local) 
- on this branch `pr1`
- create a new file `merge.md` & add some text... `writing new code for this app & reuesting to be pulled into main, by your name`
- then: `Commit`
- toggle back to the main branch, still on GitHub 
- using the notification or via `Pull Requests` menu

## What to know
- a pull request (PR or pr) is the "coversation" about a merge.
- This happens on GH (not on local, .git)
- a pull request on GH is a precurosor to a proposed merge "event"
- pr === converation && merge === event
